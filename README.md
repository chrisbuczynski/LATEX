# Ciekawe_zadania-zbiór_zadan:
I created 'a mini workbook' of Maths problems for my students interested in mathematics and more creative tasks. I'm sharing the PDF file with the final result and a fragment of the TeX code: the main code in the file "Ciekawe zadania" imports codes from other files, including the list of problems and solutions (here, I'm sharing problem number 6).

# Równanie różniczkowe Bessela:
Presentation prepared in LaTeX using the {beamer} class.
